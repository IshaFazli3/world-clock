# world-clock

I started this project knowing that I would run into some challenges. I wanted to mainly focus on my JavaScript and how I can use it to make it make something functional. 
I decided to build a world-clock. But I was not alone. I did it as a student attending SheCodes. I got help through the team in Slack. I am greateful for the support.

I felt like the biggest struggle I had to face was using a API. It is quite difficult to find the right API and use it through the code the best way possible. 
I am glad that I built this project becuase it made my googling skills better. Also, I have gained a better insight on how to use an API efficiently and effectively.

This is a world clock app that guesses your current location time.
